Javascript Exercises - Basics
-----------------------------
In this file you can find some exercises to put your Javascript skills to the test.
These exercises are based on the 'basic' chapters in our course.
Try to avoid the temptation of looking up the answer to maximize your learning.

Imaginary bonus points for using more efficient coding practices like arrow functions and ternary operators where applicable.

GOOD LUCK!

/* Exercise 1
-----------------------------
Write a function that checks two numbers, return true if one of the numbers is 10 OR if the sum of the two numbers is 20, otherwise return false.
*/


/* Exercise 2

*/


/* Exercise 3

Only add the exclamation mark if it is not already present at the end of the string.

For example 'test' returns 'TEST!'
*/


/* Exercise 4
-----------------------------
Write a function that takes a string as an argument, take the first 3 and the last 3 characters of this string and add them together.
The length of the string needs to be 7 or more, if not send a message to the console.

For example 'Test this function' returns 'Tesion'
*/


/* Exercise 5
-----------------------------
Write a function that compares two numbers and returns the value that is closest to 100.
Make sure this also works when passing negative numbers or numbers higher than 100.
*/


/* Exercise 6
-----------------------------
Write a function that multiplies a given number by the value of Pi.
Have a default value of 1 for the number.
Round the result to the nearest integer.
Log the result to the console with the message '... multiplied by Pi and rounded = ...'.
*/


/* Exercise 7
-----------------------------
Write a function that checks if an array of numbers is sorted in ascending order.
*/



/* Exercise 8
-----------------------------
Write a function that performs a basic arithmetic operation on two numbers.
The function should accept three arguments: two numbers and a string representing the operation ('+', '-', '*', '/').
